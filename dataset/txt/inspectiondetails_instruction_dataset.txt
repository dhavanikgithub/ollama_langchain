The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducts routine inspections of pharmaceutical, medical device, and related manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with federal regulations. These inspections are documented and classified based on the outcome. Each inspection is linked to a company, legally referred to by its legal name, which represents the registered business entity operating the inspected facility. The legal name in the dataset is effectively the name of the individual company responsible for the site under inspection.

Companies are often part of a larger organizational structure. The enterprise name represents the parent corporation or group that owns or oversees multiple subsidiary companies or operational units. In this context, the enterprise acts as a superset, while the legal name (or company name) is a subset within that hierarchy. For example, "3M" as an enterprise may include multiple companies such as 3M Company, 3M Health Care Business, or 3M ESPE Dental Products, each operating at different facilities or specializing in different business functions.

Each inspection record includes the FEI number (FDA Establishment Identifier) used to uniquely identify the inspected facility, the country and address of the firm, the inspection end date, the fiscal year in which the inspection occurred, and a classification such as NAI (No Action Indicated) or VAI (Voluntary Action Indicated), which reflects the outcome of the inspection.

By analyzing these inspection records grouped by enterprise, you can gain insight into the compliance performance of a parent company across all its owned or affiliated entities. This structure enables powerful traceability and accountability in regulatory surveillance models.

Instruction for RAG Model – Handling Query for NAI Classification Companies:quit
When a user asks for a list of companies with an NAI (No Action Indicated) classification from FDA inspections, extract only those inspection records where the classification field equals "NAI". For each of these records, return a summary that includes:

The legal name of the company (which represents the operating unit or facility inspected),

And the enterprise name (which represents the parent company or corporation that owns or oversees the company).

Present the result as a list or table, grouping or labeling entries clearly by enterprise, with the corresponding company names listed under each. If a company appears multiple times with NAI classification under the same enterprise, include it only once to avoid redundancy unless inspection-level details are explicitly requested.

This approach helps users identify which facilities under each corporate umbrella have maintained compliance without regulatory action during inspections.
